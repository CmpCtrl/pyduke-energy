# pyDukeEnergy

Python3 wrapper for the unofficial Duke Energy API.

Designed to work with Home Assistant. Unlikely to ever be fully implemented. The primary goal is to expose Duke Energy Gateway usage information.

**NOTE** This API is not official and so this library could stop working at any time without warning. There are multiple other libraries on GitHub that are dead already due to this.
